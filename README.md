Welcome to My Model on Malaria Transmission (trial 2)

# Malaria Transmission Model

This project develops and analyzes mathematical models of malaria transmission, 
focusing on SIR based approaches. The goal is to generate insights for 
pandemic preparedness and inform public health decision making in Tanzania.

## Objectives
- Develop compartmental models (SIR, SEIR, etc.)
- Simulate interventions (bed nets, treatment, vaccines)
- Generate policy relevant insights through scenario analysis

## Installation and Setup

Welcome to the Installation & Setup section. 
To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malaria-transmission-model2.git
cd malaria-transmission-model2

```
### 2. Install R and required packages
```bash
install.packages(c("deSolve", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))

source("src/analysis/transmission_analysis.R")
```

## Usage
Once packages are installed, you can run the models and analysis.

### Run the base SIR model
```bash
source("src/models/sir_model.R")
```
### Run the SEIR model
```bash
source("src/models/seir_model.R")
```
### Generate transmission analysis plots
```bash
source("src/analysis/transmission_analysis.R")
```
Expected outputs:
1.Epidemic curves for SIR/SEIR models
2.Intervention comparison plots
3.Summary tables saved in the output/ folder
